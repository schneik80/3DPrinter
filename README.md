3DPrinter
=========

This is the GitHub site for ongoing development of an eventorbot 3D printer.
The design is being done as an experiment in mechanical design using pre-release versions of Autodesk's Fusion 360 design software.

You are welcome to fork and work on this project of you are a Fusion 360 beta customer.

I have several branches for the design.
* The original steel tube frame design
* A modified frame from sheet metal featuring easier internal access but with increased fabrication complexity and cost
* A sheet metal frame that is a complete O instead of the original C frame shape
* New enclosed extruded aluminum frame using rounded extrusions. This can no longer be considered an eventorbot derivative (Active developed branch)
* Variation of the aluminum frame using square extrusions
